I think we have to implement all tech specs for your project.



Web and Mobile Application Development: The first step is to develop a web interface and mobile application that is compatible with Android, iOS, Windows, and Mac platforms.
I'm going to use web development frameworks such as React for the web interface and React Native for the mobile application.



Computer Vision and Machine Learning: The next step is to utilize advanced computer vision algorithms and machine learning techniques to process the images captured from different angles and generate an accurate 3D self-mannequin with realistic face and texture.
I'm going to use computer vision libraries such as OpenCV and machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
and I will use powerful Full-body Mesh Recovery Deep Learning model- Pyramidal Mesh Alignment Feedback (PyMAF) for human mesh recovery.



Measurement System: The third step is to implement a robust measurement system that extracts body measurements from the 3D self-mannequin.
we can computer vision techniques such as pose estimation and keypoint detection to identify body landmarks and extract measurements.
I'm going to use XGBoost deep learning model for 3D human measurement system.



360-Degree Visualization: The fourth step is to integrate a 360-degree visualization feature that allows users to virtually try on their tailored suits/dresses/sarees/blouse on the self-mannequin, assessing fitment and style from all angles.
I think we can use 3D rendering libraries such as Three.js or Babylon.js.



User Login and Profile Management: The fifth step is to include a secure user login and profile management system, enabling users to easily access and update their measurements and view their complete history.
I will use authentication and authorization frameworks such as OAuth or JWT or my own Auth system for your project.



API Development: The sixth step is to develop comprehensive APIs for seamless integration with the client's website, facilitating a smooth user experience and centralized data management.
I'm going to use python web API framework - Django.



I hope to discuss more details through the chat. Thank you.

I am in another call, till what time you will be available?

Beau Maruff 10:09 AM
Hello. How are you? you need to develop all specs by me? Please let me know which module I have to develope in your project.

Sure. Will wait..

I'm available now to discuss on the project.

Let me check on it.

Beau Maruff 10:48 AM
Ok, I got it all specs what I have to do.

So what kind of model do you like to implement for 3D human body reconstruction?

I'm going to use Pyramidal Mesh Alignment Feedback (PyMAF) deep learning model for human mesh recovery.

PyMAF leverages a feature pyramid and enables an alignment feedback loop in deep neural network and improve human mesh recovery correctness.

What do you think of it?

I am Okay with-it as long as it is taking correct measurements and giving me self 3D model. Please send me your proposal with delivery timelines.

Beau Maruff 12:01 PM
I will finish 3D human mesh functionality with PyMAF training and testing within 7 days. and finish 3D garments reconstruction with multi-garment net within 7 days.

I will implement rendering system with Blender cycle in 5 days.

Great.. Let's connect and discuss on the next steps.

Are you in US pacific time?

Beau Maruff 06:22 AM
Hello, I'm available now. Please discuss more details. So Please let me know your plan for this project.

I have to develop all specs from scratch. right?

IpVoyage Technologies 07:25 AM
Are you available now?

Yes.

I have no camera and earphone on my pc right now. If you don't mind. let's discuss through the chat.

Sure.

Please let me know your dev plan on this project.

We need to create this as SAS application, which can be connected independently with any platform through APIs or token system. 
This tool will have an independent database, wherein users can access their saved pictures', correct their measurements, 
put on the custom tailored fittings before they make any purchase. Please submit your complete proposal with tech stack, 
timelines (as provided earlier), testing methodologies, roll out strategies etc.

IpVoyage Technologies 07:46 AM
We can finalize to contract after signing an NDA and start our work. 
BTW, once development starts, it's difficult to communicate in chat, 
we need to see the product development through virtual meeting room and discuss if any modifications are required. 
I need your help to support the tool in future. We can discuss the commercials separately for the support after 3 months.

Beau Maruff 07:54 AM
Ok, I agree with you. I will send you complete proposal for this project. Thanks.



Hello. I have checked on your work order and I'm confident to deliver perfect result as you want.
But I have some question.
you have mentioned the project budget is 2.5k for integrating web mobile dev including frontend and api backend and 3D human mesh full body 
reconstruction&measurement, virtual dressing & rendering module. 
and  also mentioned that time line is 15 days.
As you can see, this project is really big project requiring bunch of advanced tech specs such as cutting-edige computer vision 
and machine learning techniques and it will be taken more time and efforts than you estimated on work order to finish this project.
Sorry but I hope you can ask to other deep learning developers how much will be cost such big project. 
I really want to work with you in long term relationship and hope everything will be ok.
